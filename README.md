# Escape The Asylum


### Description

On a dark and rainy night, you open your eyes and find yourself in a room you have never seen before. You wonder where you are, but the headache is too bad and no memory comes to mind.

When looking more closely at the room, some memories emerge as flashes, remembering when you were unfairly judged and imprisoned in an asylum. An urge to escape dominates your body the moment you realize the cell is partially open and this may be your only way out....


In this  game, your goal is to escape the Maze within 4 minutes. Good luck!
